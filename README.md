# Blind mood system for vedio explaination by using image-captioning

# Introduction

In this project we tried to use the potenial of image captioning in descriping the images content and extent it to descripe an entire vedio by using some vedio
manipulation techniques.

# Dataset 
I used [COCO dataset](https://cocodataset.org/#home)

### You can find the model design deatils and the algorithm in the attached [report](https://github.com/MG-98/image-captioning-for-vedio-discreption/blob/main/Computer%20vision%20project%20report.pdf)
